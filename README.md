# BMP180 Air Pressure Sensor Module with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to interface a BMP180 air pressure sensor module with an Arduino Nano to measure temperature and atmospheric pressure. The BMP180 sensor provides precise temperature and pressure readings, making it suitable for weather monitoring and altitude sensing applications.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **BMP180 Air Pressure Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **BMP180 Connections:**
   - Connect the SDA pin of the BMP180 module to the A4 pin (SDA) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the SCL pin of the BMP180 module to the A5 pin (SCL) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the BMP180 module to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the BMP180 module to the GND pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the BMP180 module to the Arduino Nano as described above.

2. **Library Installation:**
   - Install the Adafruit BMP085 library in the Arduino IDE. (Search for "Adafruit BMP085" in the Library Manager and install it.)

3. **Code Upload:**
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

4. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor to view temperature and pressure readings.
   - The serial monitor will display temperature in degrees Celsius and pressure in Pascals (Pa).

#### Applications

- **Weather Monitoring:** Monitor temperature and atmospheric pressure for weather forecasting.
- **Altitude Sensing:** Calculate altitude based on atmospheric pressure readings.
- **Environmental Sensing:** Measure environmental conditions for various applications.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and connections to prevent errors or sensor malfunctions.
- Calibrate the sensor if precise pressure readings are required for specific applications.
